Dear Sir/Madam,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Harrison Justain, and I represent HIMAGE International Limited, a United Kingdom‚Äìbased company with a global footprint in the distribution of innovative electronic appliances.

As part of our strategic expansion into North America, we are in the process of establishing operational support in the United States and Canada. While we continue to see significant growth in this region, one challenge has been efficiently processing customer payments‚Äîparticularly those made via money order or cashier‚Äôs check, which are not easily handled from our UK offices.

To support this transition, we are seeking a reliable and detail-oriented individual to serve as our local financial liaison. This is a part-time, home-based role that can be performed without interfering with any existing employment.

Role Overview:
As our representative, you would receive customer payments issued in your name, deposit them through your local bank, and forward the net amount to our corporate office. A 10% commission is allocated to you for each transaction processed. Any associated remittance fees (e.g., via Western Union or MoneyGram) should be deducted prior to forwarding the balance, so no personal funds are required at any stage.

If you are interested in this opportunity, please contact me at your earliest convenience. To initiate your onboarding, we will require the following information:
	‚Ä¢	Full Legal Name
	‚Ä¢	Residential Mailing Address
	‚Ä¢	Age
	‚Ä¢	Occupation
	‚Ä¢	Marital Status
	‚Ä¢	Direct Telephone Number

Your details will be used to verify your identity and facilitate any future correspondence or documentation.

We appreciate your time and consideration, and we look forward to potentially working with you as we continue to build our North American presence.

Warm regards,
Harrison Justain

 I am contacting you from London. My name is Jim Owens. A Top Management Official of one of the finance Corporation in London.Please do not get upset as to how I got your contact. I got your email Contact from the Internet.

I sincerely advise that you calm down to read below propos thoroughly and thereafter decide if we can do the business together. It is no setup or one of these hoaxes from Africa. This is a real deal and I mean every word I speak here.

 A US citizen, Mr. Norman Anderson has been a customer of my bank since 1988. He opens a domiciliary account with us in June 1988. The said bank account, which is at the moment in dormant, is in UK pounds sterling and has credit balance of 29.3M pounds. Last transaction carried on the account dates back to September 15,1999.


 I have been the account owner√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s confidant and account officer until above date when he was last seen in the bank. And since this time Mr. Anderson has not been to the bank nor sent in cheque for clearing. This became a source of worry to me and prompted my personal investigation as to where about and business activity of this customer.
Result of my investigation revealed that he was into oil bunkering and operated within West and Central Africa sub-regions. Further investigation proved that he was one of the victims of November 1999 raid of illegal oil bunkering merchants in Malabo Island of Equatorial Guinea.

 However, I continued my investigation and further discovered that a UK telephone number mentioned in our bank information form, which he filled when the said bank account was established, belong to hotel in London. This is a clear indication that he probably has fed my bank with false information to protect his illegal oil deals. 


I have not disclosed these findings to anyone else except this message to you. After a careful study of the account file and available data to me, I have packaged a good deal as follows; and will wish to carry it out with you. My Dear Friend, the deal here is that the money in this account will be approved and remitted to any foreigner who shows up as relation to Mr. Anderson provided such person has correct information to the account. I have such needed information and will hand it over to you as soon as we commence the transaction.
  
I will source all necessary documents and forward them to you for 
Direct submission to  the bank. With my position as the foreign operations manager we will quietly remove this money from the bank without hitches. I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have any problem in regularizing all necessary 
documents and transferring the credit balance of the said account to your nominated bank account in overseas, but the problem is trust. I have spent months in trying to get an overseas reliable contact. It is worthy to note that people are unreliable these days and even derive joy in telling lies. On this ground I request you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re unreserved but sincere cooperation devoid of greed in carrying out this transaction so that no one amongst both of us shall defraud each other at the end. I am prepared to split at 60%---40% for you, provided that mine (60%) will be intact at the end.
Waits for  your expected co-operation. Reply and send your Address, tel and fax number.

 Best regards,
 Jim Owens

I hope this message reaches you in good health and confidence. My name is Jim Owens, and I am writing to you from London, where I serve in a senior executive role at a reputable financial institution.

Please allow me to apologize in advance for the unsolicited nature of this communication. Your contact information was obtained via a professional directory available through public business channels. I assure you this message is both confidential and genuine, and I respectfully request a few moments of your time to consider the nature of this proposal in full.

Over the course of my work, I have been closely involved with a dormant account held by a former client of the bank, an American national named Mr. Norman Anderson, who opened a foreign currency account with us in June 1988. The account is held in Pound Sterling and currently carries a credit balance of ¬£29.3 million. The last recorded activity on the account was dated September 15, 1999.

As the client‚Äôs former account officer and trusted point of contact, I undertook a private investigation after prolonged inactivity raised concern. Public and regional records strongly indicate that Mr. Anderson may have been a victim of a security operation targeting oil-related enterprises in Malabo Island, Equatorial Guinea, in late 1999. It appears he was involved in the offshore oil trading sector across West and Central Africa. Further inquiries also revealed that contact information originally provided to the bank was linked to a London hotel, suggesting the client may have supplied misleading data to shield his activities.

Given the extended dormancy of the account, and in line with internal risk and compliance protocols, the account will be flagged for forfeiture in the coming fiscal cycle if no claim is made. However, under existing provisions, the balance can be legally transferred to a qualified foreign party presenting a credible claim as a next of kin.

This is where your assistance would be instrumental.

I am in possession of all relevant internal data and legal references necessary to facilitate a successful and discreet claim on the account. With your cooperation, we can initiate proceedings to release the funds in your name. As an executive with oversight in foreign operations, I am fully positioned to guide the process and ensure all regulatory and documentation requirements are met without issue.

This proposal is strictly based on mutual trust and transparency, and I am seeking a partner who can demonstrate discretion, reliability, and a shared interest in the success of the arrangement. I propose a distribution structure of 60% to me and 40% to you, with your portion transferred upon conclusion to an account of your choosing.

Should this be of interest, kindly respond at your earliest convenience, providing the following details so we may initiate private dialogue:
	‚Ä¢	Full Name
	‚Ä¢	Residential Address
	‚Ä¢	Telephone Number
	‚Ä¢	Fax Number (if available)

Please consider this communication private and sensitive. I will await your reply to proceed further.

Warm regards,

Spain. This client has a total deposit of Thirty Two Million United States 
Dollars in our vaults. After the 9/11 incidents, our company policy do not 
permit cash deposit, so he confided in me as the foreign operations officer 
to make this deposit since June 2004. She did this to avoid traces f the 
money to her since her husband, president Olusegun Obansanjo was against any 
corruption and embezzlement of funds.

The last communication I had with her was on the 25th of August 2005, where 
she was making arrangements to claim the deposit. Thereafter it was revealed 
that she died of a surgical operation in Spain in October.  After the 
acknowledgement of her death, it became apparent that there was no claim to 
her funds since she listed no next of kin in her bio-data form. She made the 
deposit under the name of Guardian Trust investment (GTI) and disclosed the 
content as company valuables and Antiques. This was for confidentiality and 
to reduce taxes.

If no claim is made within six months, the company under its storage terms 
and conditions will legally auction the content of the deposit. If 
discovered that the content is cash, it will be confiscated and I would be 
penalised, since I accepted the cash deposit against the companys 
regulations. As a staff, it is impossible for me to have access to the funds 
or claim it myself. More so, such valuable deposits are kept at a different 
branch, where we have our terminal facilities. Consequently, it is important 
that I find a credible candidate to play the role of the Trustee or 
representative of Guardian Trust investment to help claim the deposit.  It 
is on this ground that I need your assistance to claim the funds which will 
be possible with the information I hold. Once this is achieved, you shall be 
entitled to 50% of the total funds while I shall retain the balance 50%.

I am aware of the risks involved in this proposal, therefore I ask that you 
consider the factors above and keep it strictly confidential. However, if 
you feel you are unable to
fulfil this role, I request you discard of this letter.

I look forward to hearing form you.

representative of Guardian Trust investment to help arrogate the deposit.  It 
is on this ground that unity need your assistance to claim the funds which will 
be possible with the information I hold. Once this is achieved, you shall be 
entitled to fifty% of the total funds while unity shall retain the balance 50%.

I am aware of the risks involved in this proposal, therefore unity ask that you 
consider the factors above and keep it strictly confidential. However, if 
you feel you are unable to
fulfil this role, I request you discard of this letter.

I look forward to hearing soma you.

Thank you.

Mr Martins  Imaa  Lucas",0.4796036779880523,"Dear [Recipient],

I trust this message reaches you well. My name is Mr. Martins Imaa Lucas, and I am part of the Senior Custodial Oversight Division within a private asset management and securities firm based in Europe.

I am contacting you in connection with a high-level reconciliation process concerning a secured corporate asset held in our long-term custodial registry. The holding in question is associated with a corporate client file titled Guardian Trust Investment (GTI), a designation utilized by the late Chief (Mrs.) Stella Obasanjo, who was formerly engaged with our institution prior to her passing in 2005.

The portfolio in question‚Äîsecured under corporate seal‚Äîwas established in 2004 and classified as non-financial physical assets. However, internal disclosures indicate that the true nature of the contents is of liquid value, originally deposited under extraordinary terms due to sensitive geopolitical affiliations at the time.

Since the passing of the principal, and in the absence of formally recorded succession instructions or institutional beneficiaries, this portfolio has remained unresolved and is now approaching a compliance-triggering maturity threshold. Under our internal charter, all legacy portfolios deemed inactive and unresolved beyond a set window become subject to structural decommissioning, at which point the asset may be absorbed under institutional recovery frameworks.

In alignment with my fiduciary responsibilities, and given my privileged access to archival documentation, I have identified a unique pathway by which an external party‚Äîsuch as yourself‚Äîcould be engaged as a formal custodian proxy on behalf of the original corporate entity. All procedural elements are intact to facilitate this transition under existing regulatory allowances, and I am fully positioned to coordinate the transition discreetly from within the system.

Should you be open to an exploratory conversation, I am prepared to share the necessary dossiers and facilitate the process from initiation to full settlement through compliant channels. Upon resolution, a customary facilitation arrangement would be established to reflect the effort and discretion required on both sides.

Should you have any reservations or be unable to assume this role, I fully understand and ask only that you kindly disregard this message in confidence.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Warm regards,
Mr. Martins Imaa Lucas

I hope this message reaches you in good standing. My name is Joseph Benson, a legal practitioner and partner at a Lagos-based private law firm specializing in cross-border estate and trust administration.

I am reaching out regarding a matter of unclaimed private estate assets related to a former foreign client, Mr. Larry Glenn, who was formerly engaged in contract services with a multinational energy consortium operating in Nigeria.

In April 1999, Mr. Glenn and his immediate family were tragically involved in a fatal traffic incident along the Sagbama Expressway. Extensive efforts have since been made‚Äîthrough both domestic channels and diplomatic liaisons‚Äîto identify any verifiable legal heirs or surviving family. Regrettably, all attempts to locate such parties have proved unsuccessful over the past several years.

Given the lapse of time and in accordance with the governing custodial terms under Nigerian financial statutes, the financial institution holding the related portfolio has issued a compliance directive. The institution has requested that a qualified legal proxy or estate affiliate be presented within ten working days, or the holdings‚Äîcurrently valued at USD $19.8 million‚Äîwill be deemed dormant and subject to government reclamation protocols.

After a thorough internal review of Mr. Glenn‚Äôs client file and its supporting documentation, I am in a position to facilitate the assignment of a vetted external custodian to act on behalf of the estate entity. I am prepared to guide this matter through the appropriate legal channels and ensure all fiduciary, regulatory, and identity protocols are satisfied.

Should you be in a position to support this custodianship role, I would be pleased to provide the required authorizations and supporting legal documentation to begin formal proceedings. Upon resolution, an equitable facilitation arrangement can be made in accordance with international asset recovery practices.

Kindly treat this correspondence as strictly confidential. If you are unable or unwilling to be considered for this process, please disregard this message with appreciation for your discretion.

Dear friend




My proposal to you will be very surprising as we have not had any
personal contact. However I sincerely seek your confidence in this
transaction which I propose to you as a person of transparency and caliber

Let me first start by introducing myself properly to you My name

of Angola) I got your email address from network directory I apologize
if I infringed  on your privacy.

You may know that my Uncle was recently killed in a battle with
the government troops of Angola led by President Dos Santos on friday 22nd
February 2002

Now Mr Antonio Dembo who was my Uncle's second in command has
assumed office as leader of UNITA In spite of this UNITA is like
a herd of cattle without shepherd Prominent members like Carlos
Morgado are still lobbying to oust him and assume office as leader
to enrich themselves and some of them who see me as a threat to
their ambitions including Mr Dembo are planning to kill me For

However I am a young man who has ambitions and I am not in any

of some of my Uncle's money that arose from Diamonds sales This
money US$20 million was already on its way to my Uncle's Swiss
Bank account It was on transit with a safe deposit company
in Europe when the tragic incident of my Uncle's death occurred.

As a matter of fact this is the reason I chose to come and
seek political asylum. It is very clear with the way things are
now that President Dos Santos will lobby the International Community

to freeze my Uncle's assets and accounts abroad to ground UNITA
since he has already done this in Angola.

I plan to use this money to safeguard my future It is very essential
that you understand that the kind of trust and confidence I want
to put in you is extraordinary and an act of desperation on my
part in order not to lose this money Please treat this contact
with utmost secrecy and confidentiality for security and safety reasons.

The help I need from you is clearing the box containing the money
from the security company after which it will be deposited in
an account in your name . The money
shall remain in your custody till my asylum application is granted
and I have the permit to conduct business then you will transfer
the account to me Meanwhile the money can be invested into risk-free
profitable ventures and there will an agreement to protect my interest.
I have all the documents that will enable you claim the consignment from
the security company.
To make this deal relisable i need a committment from you that it will be
kept confidential,your tel nd fax numbers including mobile for easy
communications,your permanent address as well as some form of
identification.
For your reliable assistance I will reward you with 20% of the money
and we shall use 5% to carry out every expenses that we incurr during the

The superior free email service for dog lovers",0.4196809828281402,"Dear [Recipient Name],

I hope this message finds you well. You are being contacted in a strictly confidential capacity by the advisory team at CLS International, acting on behalf of a client currently under special protection within the European Union. This outreach pertains to an international estate matter involving a series of high-value, family-held foreign assets previously under the care of a late public figure from Southern Africa.

Our client, Mr. Carlos S., was previously affiliated with a senior leadership office during a transitional political era. Following the passing of his uncle‚Äîan internationally known figure‚Äîour office was mandated to coordinate the secure repositioning of non-declared private assets, originally held in escrow by a third-party financial custodial service in Western Europe.

One such holding, a consignment originally registered under discretionary transit protocols in 2002, remains in dormant status and is now subject to enhanced compliance review due to the principal‚Äôs passing and recent political developments. The asset, valued at approximately USD $20 million, requires third-party representation in order to satisfy local KYC (Know Your Customer) and jurisdictional custodial continuity regulations.

We are currently seeking a non-affiliated, professionally positioned individual to assist in this matter as an appointed custodian of record. Your profile was identified through a referral-based private network as someone with the discretion and integrity suitable for this role.

The following framework has been proposed:
	‚Ä¢	You would act as a temporary fiduciary agent under a limited mandate agreement.
	‚Ä¢	The asset would be assigned for safekeeping under your name until our client‚Äôs residency and commercial status is normalized.
	‚Ä¢	A certified legal framework will govern the custodial relationship, with full transparency, indemnity, and verification at all stages.
	‚Ä¢	A facilitation honorarium of 20% of the total holding is reserved for your engagement.
	‚Ä¢	5% is allocated to legal, verification, and administrative costs.
	‚Ä¢	The remaining 75% is reserved for the benefit of the principal‚Äôs dependents and long-term trust allocation.

If this arrangement is of interest, we kindly request a secure reply to savimbicar1@fizgigs.com with the following:
	‚Ä¢	Full legal name
	‚Ä¢	Primary and alternate telephone numbers
	‚Ä¢	Jurisdiction of residence
	‚Ä¢	Preferred business address for courier correspondence
	‚Ä¢	Scanned or encrypted copy of a professional identification document (e.g., passport or license) for internal compliance screening

Please note that no funds are required from you at any stage, and this process will be managed exclusively through certified legal and custodial channels. CLS International will issue all supporting documentation upon confirmation of interest.

Whether you are in a position to assist or not, we kindly ask that this communication be handled with absolute discretion. This message is not part of any marketing campaign, and your details have not been distributed to third parties.

We thank you for your consideration and remain at your service for any preliminary questions.
