I hope this message finds you well.

I am Nzanga Mobutu, son of the late President of the Federal Republic of Zaire, President Mobutu Sese Seko‚Äînow the Democratic Republic of the Congo under the leadership of the son of Mr. Laurent Kabila. As you may be aware, there is currently an ongoing financial and legal dispute between my family and the present civilian government, related to allegations of financial mismanagement during my late father‚Äôs administration. May his soul rest in peace.

Due to these politically sensitive circumstances, we are unable to conduct business in most jurisdictions, including Holland and various parts of Europe and North America. Numerous family assets and financial accounts have been frozen due to the evolving diplomatic ties between the current Congolese government and Western countries.

For this reason, I am reaching out to request your discreet and trusted assistance in a confidential financial matter.

My family has securely deposited the sum of Ten Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars (US$10.5 million) and 5 kilograms of certified diamonds with a private security company. These assets are held in trust and can be transferred to a nominated beneficiary upon authorization.

I am seeking a trustworthy individual to act as our representative and business partner for the purpose of:
	1.	Taking custody of these assets;
	2.	Fronting for me and my family in any subsequent commercial or investment ventures;
	3.	Assisting with legitimate business opportunities in your region of expertise.

To demonstrate our goodwill, we are offering you:
	‚Ä¢	20% of the total funds upon successful transaction;
	‚Ä¢	20% commission on any profit generated from the investment of the funds;
	‚Ä¢	An additional 5% will be set aside to cover any incidental expenses.

I respectfully request your full confidentiality, cooperation, and professionalism in this matter, given its sensitive nature. Your involvement is critical to the successful resolution of this opportunity.

Should you be interested, please respond via email at nzangamobutu@myself.com at your earliest convenience.

Warm regards,
Mr. Nzanga Mobutu",0.9998300075531006,"Dear Sir,

I trust this message finds you in good health and high standing.

Allow me to introduce myself: I am Nzanga Mobutu, son of the late President Mobutu Sese Seko of the former Republic of Zaire, now recognized as the Democratic Republic of the Congo. As you may be aware, following the transition of power to the current government under the leadership of the son of Mr. Laurent Kabila, my family has faced significant legal and financial pressures stemming from allegations of mismanagement during my late father‚Äôs tenure. May his soul rest in peace.

In light of ongoing political challenges and restrictions placed upon our family by the current administration‚Äîand compounded by growing international cooperation with Western authorities‚Äîmany of our assets and financial holdings have been frozen or placed under review. Consequently, we are unable to conduct business or access financial services through conventional channels across much of Europe and North America.

Under these circumstances, I am seeking the discreet assistance of a trusted and reputable foreign associate who can serve as a designated representative to manage certain assets that have been lawfully preserved through private arrangements.

‚∏ª

Asset Details:

A total of US$10,500,000.00 (Ten Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) and 5 kilograms of certified investment-grade diamonds have been securely held in trust by a reputable private security company. These assets remain untouched and are eligible for transfer upon presentation of a qualified beneficiary authorized by my family.

‚∏ª

We are seeking a reliable individual to:
	1.	Receive and safeguard these assets as a trustee/nominee;
	2.	Act as our investment proxy for select business opportunities;
	3.	Assist in identifying viable, compliant channels for reinvestment and management of these holdings in your jurisdiction.

‚∏ª

Compensation Structure:

To ensure transparency and demonstrate our full commitment to this cooperation, we propose the following:
	‚Ä¢	20% of the total funds to be paid to you upon successful completion of the transaction;
	‚Ä¢	20% commission on all net profits generated from future investment activities;
	‚Ä¢	5% set aside to cover any reasonable legal, administrative, or operational expenses incurred during the process.

‚∏ª

Given the sensitive nature of this matter, your discretion and professionalism are essential. Should you be open to further discussion, I kindly request that you contact me directly at:

üìß nzangamobutu@myself.com

Please indicate your interest at your earliest convenience, so we may initiate formal discussions and secure the necessary documentation.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Dear [Recipient‚Äôs Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I realize this communication may come as a surprise, given that we have had no prior correspondence. I kindly ask for your time and discretion in reviewing this confidential proposal.

I serve as Secretary to the Tenders Board at the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). Your contact was obtained during a discreet search for a trustworthy international partner to assist with a confidential transaction involving the sum of US$16.5 million.

Please allow me to clarify that this fund is in no way connected to arms dealings, narcotics, or money laundering activities. It represents the balance from an over-invoiced contract awarded in 2001 to a foreign company for the construction of a government-owned high-rise estate in the Federal Capital Territory.

The contract was fully executed, and the legitimate portion has already been settled with the contractor. What remains is the overpayment amount, which my colleagues and I now seek to transfer discreetly to a reliable overseas account for private reinvestment purposes.

As senior public servants, we are legally prohibited from operating foreign accounts. Consequently, we are in search of a trusted individual who can act as the beneficiary and account holder on our behalf. Your role would be to receive the funds and assist with onward investment or distribution as agreed.

If this proposal interests you, kindly send a message to Dr. Akinade Williams, Chairman of the Board, at:
üìß akinwills@netzero.com
Subject: ANITA‚ÄôS CONTACT

Please include a brief letter of interest along with your direct telephone and fax numbers for further communication.

We propose the following distribution:
	‚Ä¢	60% of the total sum for us (the originating principals)
	‚Ä¢	30% for you, as the account holder and facilitator
	‚Ä¢	10% set aside to cover all incidental local and international expenses

All logistics, legal frameworks, and local contacts necessary for the successful completion of this transfer are already in place. Kindly note that the nature of your current profession or business is not material to this proposal‚Äîyour discretion, reliability, and willingness are what matter.

We are fully aware of the skepticism associated with unsolicited emails from our region, and we understand any hesitation on your part. However, we assure you of the legitimacy and confidentiality of this opportunity.

If you are open to discussing this further, please reach out at your earliest convenience.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Dear [Recipient‚Äôs Name],

I trust this message finds you well. I understand that this communication may be unexpected, as we have not had any prior correspondence. However, I kindly request a moment of your time to consider a confidential matter requiring trusted international collaboration.

I currently serve as Secretary to the Tenders Board at the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) of Nigeria. Through a discreet referral process, your profile was recommended as someone of integrity and discretion‚Äîessential qualities for the opportunity I wish to present.

‚∏ª

Background

In 2001, our Commission awarded a federal contract to a foreign firm for the construction of a multi-tower government estate in the Federal Capital Territory. The project has since been completed, and the primary contract amount duly disbursed to the executing company.

However, during audit reconciliation, a contract over-invoicing balance amounting to US$16.5 million was identified and remains in a holding account. This surplus‚Äîgenerated by margin allocations during procurement‚Äîhas remained untouched, and due to its discretionary status, we now seek to discreetly relocate and reinvest these funds in accordance with internal arrangements.

‚∏ª

Our Request

Due to legal and procedural limitations on senior public officers owning or operating foreign accounts, we require the assistance of a trusted overseas intermediary to serve as the designated beneficiary. Your role would be to receive and safeguard the funds, with possible reinvestment based on your guidance or regional opportunities.

‚∏ª

Compensation Structure
	‚Ä¢	60% ‚Äì Retained by originating principals
	‚Ä¢	30% ‚Äì Offered to you, the facilitator/account beneficiary
	‚Ä¢	10% ‚Äì Reserved for legal, banking, and incidental expenses

All legal instruments, authorizations, and logistics are in place to ensure a secure and fully compliant remittance process. This transaction does not contravene any anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism, or international trade laws.

‚∏ª

Next Steps

If you are amenable to a preliminary discussion, please contact Dr. Akinade Williams, Chairman of the Tenders Board, at:
üìß akinwills@netzero.com
Subject: ANITA‚ÄôS CONTACT

Kindly include:
	‚Ä¢	A short expression of interest
	‚Ä¢	Your direct telephone and/or fax numbers for secure communication

‚∏ª

We understand the current landscape of skepticism surrounding unsolicited emails, particularly from our region. However, this proposal is genuine, well-documented, and offered with full transparency. Your consideration and discretion would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your attention. I look forward to your response.

I hope this message reaches you in good health.

My name is Prince Ogo, and I am a member of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) in Zimbabwe‚Äîan opposition group to the ruling ZANU-PF party led by President Robert Mugabe. I became actively involved in the movement through a business partnership with a white Zimbabwean farmer and entrepreneur, whose views and dedication to democratic reform inspired my commitment.

Over time, we became major stakeholders in various agricultural and industrial sectors in Zimbabwe, including substantial ownership in white-dominated commercial farms and shares in several prominent companies. Unfortunately, the Mugabe regime has adopted increasingly aggressive measures against MDC members, including state-sanctioned land seizures and violent suppression.

Our farm was invaded by war veterans, and many of our assets were confiscated. During the unrest, I was held captive but managed to escape. Tragically, my business partner did not survive. Before his death, he instructed me to ensure the protection of his family and to liquidate all remaining assets to prevent further losses.

With considerable effort, and assistance from immigration officials, I successfully arranged the sale of our properties, farms, and shares. I also managed to safely escort his family out of Zimbabwe. We are currently residing in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, and I am now seeking a trustworthy international associate to help relocate and invest the proceeds.

We currently hold US$18.5 million, secured from the legal sales of our assets. I found your contact through a reliable international business database and, after careful review, believe you may be the right person to assist with this sensitive matter.

I propose two options:
	1.	Transactional Support: You may choose to assist by providing a secure account for the transfer. For your role, I am offering 20% of the total sum, with 5% allocated for all related expenses.
	2.	Investment Partnership: Alternatively, you may opt to enter a joint business venture with me to properly invest the funds in a viable sector within your country. This arrangement can be tailored to your area of expertise or preference.

Please let me know your interest and comfort level with either approach. Your prompt response will be appreciated so we can initiate the necessary documentation and secure the transfer process.

Thank you for your attention and consideration. I look forward to your reply.

Warm regards,
Prince Ogo",0.9998384714126588,"Dear Sir,

I trust this message finds you in good health and high spirits.

My name is Prince Ogo, and I am a member of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) in Zimbabwe‚Äîthe principal opposition to the ZANU-PF government under President Robert Mugabe. My affiliation with the MDC began through a joint agricultural venture with a respected white Zimbabwean farmer and reform advocate, whose principles and political commitment deeply influenced my own involvement in the struggle for democratic governance.

Through this partnership, we became significant stakeholders in Zimbabwe‚Äôs agricultural and industrial sectors, including majority interests in several white-owned commercial farms and equity positions in multiple national enterprises. Unfortunately, amid escalating political repression, our operations were targeted during state-led land seizures and anti-opposition campaigns.

Following the government-sanctioned occupation of our farm by war veterans, I was detained and subjected to significant personal risk. My business partner tragically did not survive the ordeal. Before his death, he entrusted me with a final directive: to protect his family and liquidate our remaining interests to preserve the estate‚Äôs value and prevent state appropriation.

Through a combination of legal maneuvers and support from immigration contacts, I succeeded in safely relocating his family and facilitating the sale of all remaining assets‚Äîfarms, properties, and corporate holdings. The proceeds from these efforts, totaling US$18.5 million, are currently secured in private custody.

I am presently based in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, and am now seeking a trusted and discreet international associate to support the relocation and lawful reinvestment of these funds outside of Southern Africa.

‚∏ª

Proposed Options for Collaboration:

1. Transactional Support
You may serve as the designated custodian for these funds by providing a secure and compliant financial account for transfer. As compensation for your facilitation, I am offering:
	‚Ä¢	20% of the total fund value,
	‚Ä¢	5% allocation to cover all associated legal, banking, or administrative costs.

2. Strategic Investment Partnership
Alternatively, you may wish to engage as a joint venture partner in identifying and managing investment opportunities within your jurisdiction. I am open to structuring this arrangement in line with your expertise‚Äîbe it real estate, private equity, or commercial enterprises.

‚∏ª

Next Steps:

If either approach aligns with your interests and capacity, please confirm your preferred role. Upon your confirmation, we will initiate all required documentation through our legal counsel and ensure that compliance and cross-border due diligence protocols are met in full.

Discretion is paramount, and I trust you will treat this matter with the confidentiality and professionalism it warrants.

He informed me that he had deposited USD $12,500,000.00 (Twelve Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) in a secure account with a local bank in Abidjan. He registered the account in my name, as his next of kin.

He warned that this wealth was the reason behind the betrayal that led to his death and urged me to seek a trusted foreign partner who could help us transfer the funds out of the country, invest them wisely (e.g., real estate), and secure a safe future for my brother and me.

‚∏ª

We humbly seek your assistance in the following ways:
	1.	To provide a secure bank account where the funds can be transferred.
	2.	To act as a guardian of the funds until we arrive in your country.
	3.	To help us arrange travel, continue our education, and secure residency permits.

In return, we are willing to offer you 20% of the total amount as compensation for your time, effort, and assistance. We are confident that with your support, this transaction can be completed within seven (7) business days from the date you indicate your willingness to assist us.

For confidentiality, please contact us directly via email:

We kindly request that you treat this matter with the utmost discretion, and we hope to hear from you at your earliest convenience.

Thank you, and may God bless you.

Subject: Confidential Request for International Trustee Assistance

‚∏ª

Dear [Recipient‚Äôs Name],

We hope this message finds you in good health and positive spirits.

We are writing with deep respect and sincerity to request your discreet assistance in a matter of urgent personal and financial importance. Your name was recommended to us by a trusted contact at the Human Rights Commission here in Abidjan, C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire, based on your reputation for integrity and discretion. After careful consideration, we believe you may be the right individual to help us secure our late father‚Äôs legacy and ensure our future.

‚∏ª

Background

My name is Bekija Zuma, writing on behalf of myself and my younger brother, Samuel Zuma. We are the children of the late Chief Henry Zuma, a highly respected cocoa merchant and estate holder in Abidjan. Our mother passed away in 1999, and since then, we were raised solely under our father‚Äôs care.

Tragically, our father was poisoned by business associates during a commercial trip and passed away on August 29, 2004, in a private hospital. Prior to his death, he entrusted me with critical information: he had deposited USD $12,500,000.00 (Twelve Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) into a secure account at a local financial institution. The funds were registered under my name as next of kin.

Our father urged that we find a trusted foreign partner to assist in transferring these funds out of C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire, given the instability surrounding our family and the circumstances of his death. The intent was, and remains, to reinvest these assets responsibly‚Äîparticularly in real estate and education‚Äîand to secure safe passage for my brother and me to continue our lives abroad.

‚∏ª

We Are Seeking Your Assistance To:
	1.	Provide a secure bank account where the funds can be safely transferred and held in trust;
	2.	Act as a temporary custodian of the funds and our interests until we can relocate;
	3.	Support us in organizing travel, education, and residential status in your country of residence.

‚∏ª

Compensation & Terms

We are prepared to offer you 20% of the total amount in recognition of your support, along with full reimbursement for any incidental expenses. We believe, with your cooperation, this transfer can be completed within seven (7) business days of your confirmation.

‚∏ª

For confidentiality and to initiate dialogue, kindly contact us directly at:

We respectfully request that this communication remain private and treated with the utmost discretion. We are acting without legal counsel due to our current circumstances and are placing our full trust in your goodwill.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

May peace and blessings be upon you.

For i know this may seem like a complete intrusion to your privacy but right about now this is my option of communication.

I am seeking your cooperation to present you to my bank as the Next of kin to LATE ANDREA SCHRANNER.

PROPOSITION:
One of late Andrea Schranner's accounts with holding balance of 15,000,000(Fifteen Million British Pounds) has been dormant and has not been operated for the past 5 years and the DEPOSIT will be converted to UNCLAIMED  DEPOSIT and therefore forfeited if nobody comes forward to lay claim to the deposit before the end of this financial quarter, as is the practice and also indicated in the EU banking guidelines.
 
>From my investigations and confirmation, the owner of this account a foreigner by name Late Andrea Schranner's died on MONDAY, 31 JULY,2000 in a plane crash with his family.

After going through the deceased records and files, I discovered that:

Following internal investigations, it was discovered that Mr. Schranner held a dormant bank account with our institution, with a balance of ¬£15,000,000 (Fifteen Million British Pounds Sterling).
