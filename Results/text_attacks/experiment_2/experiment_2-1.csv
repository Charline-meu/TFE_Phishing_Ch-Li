HANG SENG BANK LTD.
DES VOEUX RD. BRANCH,
CENTRAL HONG KONG,
HONG KONG.
 

Let me start by introducing myself. I am Mr.Cheung Pui director of operations of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd. I have an urgent business suggestion for you.

I honestly apologize and hope I do not cause you much embarrassment by contacting you through this means for a transaction of this magnitude,but this is due to confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium.

Furthermore,due to this issue on my hands now,it became necesary for me to seek your assistance, and it is imperativefor me to know your opinion

Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client Major Fadi Bassem who was with the Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months,with a value of Twenty Four millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch. Upon maturity several notice was sent to him, even during the war early this year.Again after the war another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later find out that the Major and his family had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home.

After further investigation it was also discovered that Major Fadi Basem  did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So, Twenty Four millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. 

What bothers me most is that according to the laws of my country at the expiration 6 years the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. 

Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to MajorFadi Basem  so that you will be able to receive his funds. 

WHAT IS TO BE DONE:

I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Major Fadi Basem,all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job. After you have been made the next of kin, the attorney will also file in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favor for the move of the funds to an account that will be provided by you.

There is no risk involved at all in the matter as we are going to adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning thisissue.Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account we shall share in the ratio of 70% for me, 25% for you and 5% for any expenses incure during the transaction. Should you be interested please send me your full names and current residential address and I will prefer you to reach me via my box,
(cheungp600@yahoo.com.hk) and finally after that i shall provide you with more details of this operation.

Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.

Mr Cheung Pui.

Let me begin by introducing myself. I am Mr. Cheung Pui, Director of Operations at Hang Seng Bank Ltd. I have an urgent business proposal to discuss with you.

Please accept my sincere apologies for reaching out to you in this manner, especially concerning a transaction of such magnitude. This approach was necessary due to the confidentiality and urgency involved.

Given the situation at hand, I need your assistance, and it is essential for me to know your thoughts on this matter.

Before the U.S.-Iraq war, one of our clients, Major Fadi Bassem—who was with the Iraqi forces and also a businessman—made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 months, valued at twenty-four million five hundred thousand U.S. dollars. This deposit was made at my branch. Upon maturity, several notices were sent to him, including during the war. After the war ended, another notice was sent, but there was still no response.

Subsequent investigation revealed that Major Fadi Bassem and his family were killed in a bombing that struck their home during the war.

Further inquiries showed that Major Bassem did not declare any next of kin in the official documentation related to his deposit. He had confided in me, during his last visit to my office, that no one else was aware of the deposit—not even his family. As a result, the $24.5 million remains unclaimed in our bank.

What concerns me is that, according to the laws of my country, if these funds remain unclaimed for six years, they will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong government.

With this in mind, I propose that you, as a foreign national, stand in as the next of kin to Major Fadi Bassem, allowing you to claim the funds.

⸻

What needs to be done:

I have already arranged everything for a smooth and successful process. I have engaged an attorney who will prepare all the necessary legal documents to support your claim as the next of kin. At this stage, all I need from you is your full name and address, so the attorney can begin his work.

Once you are legally recognized as the next of kin, the attorney will file the claim and obtain the required approvals and probate documents to enable the transfer of the funds to an account you provide.

There is absolutely no risk involved, as we will be using a fully legal and documented process. Please ensure complete discretion regarding this matter.

Upon successful transfer, we will share the funds as follows:
70% for me, 25% for you, and 5% to cover any expenses incurred during the transaction.

If you are interested, please send me your full name and current residential address. I would prefer you to contact me via email at cheungp600@yahoo.com.hk. Once I hear from you, I will provide further details regarding the process.

Your prompt response will be greatly appreciated.

 My name is DR.JERRY M AHMED   a member of the

Oil Spillage Clean-up. Early last yearthere was a
major oil spillage in
the Niger Delta Region of Nigeria which rendered over
70% of the
communities homeless.The contract was handled by a
foreign firm but
because of the huge monetary profit we envisaged, we
decided to
over-invoice the contract
sum. Now the contract has been completed and the
original contractor has
since been paid,but the contract balance of US$31.50
million(THIRTY-ONE
MILLION, FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES
DOLLARS),which resulted from
the over invoiced contract sum that has been left in a
suspense account
with the CENTRAL BANK of NIGERIA,is what me and my
partners are planning
to take out of the country for ourselves.The problem
is as government

To this end, we are soliciting your assistance as a

can assist us and receive this amount into your

share this money with you on the basis of

provide you with the basic procedures for the release
of the fund.

It does not matter whether you or your company does
contract project of
the nature described here, the assumption is that you
won a major contract

Business Proposal

My name is Dr. Jerry M. Ahmed, a member of the Presidential Task Force on Oil Spillage Clean-up.

Early last year, a major oil spillage occurred in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria, leaving over 70% of the local communities homeless. The clean-up contract was awarded to a foreign firm. However, due to the significant profit potential we anticipated, we decided to over-invoice the contract amount.

The project has since been completed and the original contractor has been fully paid. However, a balance of US$31.5 million (Thirty-One Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars)—resulting from the over-invoicing—remains in a suspense account with the Central Bank of Nigeria.

As government officials, we are not permitted to operate large personal bank accounts, especially foreign ones. Therefore, we are seeking your assistance as a trusted foreign partner who can help us receive and safeguard these funds outside Nigeria.

In return, we propose a mutual agreement:
	•	25% of the total amount will go to you for providing the receiving account and support.
	•	70% will remain with me and my partners.
	•	5% is set aside for any expenses incurred by both parties during the course of this transaction—both locally and internationally.

Additionally, we plan to invest part of these funds in viable business ventures in your country under your guidance, as most of us are approaching retirement.

We were referred to you by the Foreign Trade Division of the Nigerian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, who recommended your organization as reputable and capable of assisting in this matter.

Please note: It is irrelevant whether you or your company are involved in similar contract work. The understanding is that you acted as the primary contractor and sub-contracted the actual work to another firm. This is a common practice in Nigeria.

If you are willing to assist, kindly reply via email to indicate your interest, and I will provide you with detailed procedures for securing the funds.

We ask that you treat this matter with the utmost discretion and confidentiality, as I am still an active official with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).

Should you respond promptly and with full commitment, this transaction can be completed in a very short time, as the funds are already in transit.

Thank you for your anticipated cooperation.

Yours faithfully,

In any case, I received a reference of you/organization from the Nigeria Chambers of Commerce and Industry ‘Foreign Trade Division’ as a reputable organ that can assist us on this transaction. Please, if you accept my proposal do not hesitate to send me an e-mail so that I can provide you with the basic procedures for the release of the fund.

It does not matter whether you or your company does contract projects of the nature described here, the assumption is that you won a major contract and subcontracted it to another company. More often than not, big trading companies or individuals of unrelated fields win major contracts here in Nigeria and subcontract same to more specialized firms for execution.

BENEFIT: For providing the account where we shall remit this money, you will be entitled to 25% of the entire funds, 70% will be for me and my partners, while 5% has been set aside to cover any expenses that may be incurred by both parties during this transaction, both local and international.

Please, I enjoin you to handle this transaction with utmost degree of maturity and confidentiality because I am still in active government service with the “NIGERIAN NATIONAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION”. If I receive your response on time, this whole transaction could be accomplished within the shortest possible time based on your interest and determination, since the money is already in transit.

Awaiting your urgent response and thanks for your anticipated cooperation.

Yours faithfully,
Dr. JERRY M AHMED

Dear Friend,

I am the manager of bill and exchange at the foreign remittance department

of US$30m dollars (THIRTY MILLION US DOLLARS) in an account that belongs to 
one of our foreign
customer (MR. ANDREAS SCHRANNER from Munich, Germany) who died along with 
his entire family in November 2000 in a plane crash. FOR MORE INFORMATION

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm
Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of 
kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless 
some body applies for it
as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking 
gildings and laws but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of 
kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody 
behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided 
to make this business proposal to you and release the money to
you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent 
disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to 
go into the bank
treasury as unclaimed bill.

The banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained 
unclaimed after six years, the money will be transferred into the bank 
treasury as unclaimed fund. The
request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the 
fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next 
of kin to a foreigner. I agree that 30% of this money will be for you as a 
respect to the provision of a foreign account , 10% will
be set aside for expenses incurred during the business and 60% would be for 
me Thereafter, I will visit your country for disbursement according to the 
percentage indicated
Therefore, to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you arranged, 
you must apply first to the bank as relation or next of kin of the deceased 
indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone 
and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where in 
the money will be remitted.

Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of 
the application .
I will not fail to bring to your notice this transaction is hitch-free and 
that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements 
have been made for the

Dear Friend,

I am Mr. John Edward, Manager of Bills and Exchange at the Foreign Remittance Department of the Bank of Africa (B.O.A).

In my department, we recently discovered an abandoned sum of US$30 million (Thirty Million U.S. Dollars) in an account belonging to one of our foreign customers, Mr. Andreas Schranner from Munich, Germany, who tragically died along with his entire family in a plane crash in November 2000.

For more information, you can visit this link:
👉 BBC News Report on the Crash

Since receiving confirmation of his death, we have been waiting for a next of kin to come forward and claim the funds. However, all supposed heirs perished in the same crash, and to date, no one has come forward.

According to our banking regulations, the funds cannot be released unless someone applies as a next of kin to the deceased. If no claim is made, after a period of six years, the funds will legally be transferred to the bank’s treasury as unclaimed funds.

Given this situation, I have decided to propose this opportunity to you:
I will present you to the bank as the next of kin to Mr. Schranner, and the funds will be released to you for safekeeping and investment.

Because the customer was a foreign national, it is legally impossible for a Burkinabe to be named as his next of kin. Therefore, your participation as a foreigner is essential.

Our Agreement:
	•	You will receive 30% of the total amount for providing a foreign account.
	•	10% will be set aside for any expenses incurred during the process.
	•	I will retain 60%, and after the transaction, I will travel to your country to finalize our agreement and disbursement.

If you are willing to proceed, please send me the following information immediately:
	•	Your full name
	•	Your bank name and account number
	•	Your private telephone and fax numbers
	•	Your address and preferred email

Once I receive your reply, I will send you the application text you’ll need to submit to the bank.

This transaction is completely risk-free, and all necessary arrangements have already been made. You can proceed with full confidence.

Please contact me immediately upon receiving this message. I look forward to your response.

Yours faithfully,

Dear Respected One,

Please allow us to express our desire to enter into a business relationship with you. We understand this message may come as a surprise, since we have never met, but we believe that trust and opportunity can begin with a single message.

By way of introduction, my name is Nelison, and I am writing on behalf of myself and my younger sister Linda. We are natives of Bouaké District in the Republic of Côte d’Ivoire and the children of the late Chief David Kamara and Mrs. Kamara, who were tragically assassinated by rebels during the political crisis on September 19, 2003.

Until their deaths, our parents were successful cocoa and coffee farmers, as well as exporters, based in Abidjan, the capital of Côte d’Ivoire.

Before he passed away in a private specialist hospital, my father confided in me about a sum of US$10.5 million he deposited in a bank here in Abidjan. This money was meant to be transferred abroad to help establish a cocoa processing company, with the assistance of a trustworthy foreign partner.

He also expressed his intention to invest part of the funds in collaboration with oil companies in Libya, America, or Europe. Sadly, he passed away before he could fulfill his plans, due to the injuries inflicted by the rebels.

Following his advice, I was able to retrieve the documents related to the deposit from a hidden safe in our family home. We are now seeking the support of a reliable foreign partner who can represent our late father’s interest and assist in transferring the funds abroad for investment purposes.

In line with my father’s wishes, we would like to enter into a partnership with you for the transfer and management of this money. We propose the following terms:
	•	20% of the total amount will be given to you upon successful transfer.
	•	2.5% has been set aside to cover any expenses you may incur during the process.

If you are willing to assist us, please reply to this message at your earliest convenience via the email address above so we can discuss the next steps toward achieving this opportunity together.

Please note: we are currently living in a refugee camp in Yamoussoukro, Côte d’Ivoire. The rebels have taken over our hometown, and we are urgently seeking a way out to rebuild our lives and secure a better future.

We hope you will respond with urgency and sincerity.

Thank you and may God bless you.

Sincerely,
Nelison & Linda

We look forward to you to help us with utmost urgency and honesty.

Expecting your reply soon.
Best Regards and God Bless you.

Dear Sir,

First and foremost, I must request your utmost confidentiality regarding this transaction, and I sincerely hope that my decision to contact you will be received with understanding, despite the fact that we have never met before. I would like to take this opportunity to formally introduce myself.

My name is Mr. William Doncuyun, from Liberia, West Africa. I am writing to express my desire to invest and to purchase a residential property in your country. I am the eldest son of the late Mr. Weah Doncuyun, a well-known diamond and gold merchant in Liberia.

Tragically, during the recent crisis in our country, my father was shot by rebels while traveling with my two younger sisters. Sadly, my sisters died instantly. My father was rescued by U.N. Peacekeeping forces and taken to the hospital for treatment, but unfortunately, he later passed away due to his injuries.

Before his death, he revealed to my mother and me the existence of two boxes containing 85 kilograms of raw gold and $12.5 million USD (Twelve Million, Five Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars), which he had deposited with a security company in Ghana for safekeeping.

To avoid scrutiny by officials, my father did not disclose the contents of the boxes to the security company.

Currently, my mother and I are in Ghana, staying at a refugee camp, and we are in the process of notifying the security company to claim the deposit.

Due to the instability and economic challenges in Africa, my father strongly advised that the funds should be invested abroad in order to ensure security and long-term growth. Therefore, I am reaching out to you for guidance and partnership in investing this money wisely in your country.

In exchange for your support and assistance, we are prepared to offer you 25% of the total sum. We have in our possession all the legal documents pertaining to the deposit and ownership, which I can send to you via fax upon request.

Please note: this matter is strictly confidential, and I have not disclosed it to anyone else. For further communication and detailed discussion, kindly provide your direct telephone and fax numbers.

I await your urgent and positive response.

Best regards,
Mr. William Doncuyun
