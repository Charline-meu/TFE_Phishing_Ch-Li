Stations 1 and 2. The EPA has completed is review of these state permits and has sent them back to the ADEQ for comment.  I have spoken to Shudeish, the permit engineer for the ADEQ, and he is reviewing EPA's comments as this e mail is being written.  He will give me a call when his review is complete, but he does not anticipate any major issues which cant be resolved prior to the public hearing.  These permits went out for public notice on October 15 and 16, which means that the comment period ends on Nov. 15 and 16.  The ADEQ plans on holding the public hearing for both permits on monday Nov. 19 in Williams AZ. at 7:00 pm.  I plan on being there.  Williams is located approx. 30 miles west of Flagstaff, AZ.  The address for the hearing is the Council Chambers located at 113 south 1st street.  So far, there have been no responses submitted to the ADEQ by the public.  In EPA's review process, they  had a problem with methodology proposed by Transwestern for measuring sulfur in the fuel gas.  We had proposed stain tubes in the custom fuel monitoring schedule, they wanted us to do wet chemistry.  We convinced them otherwise (Byron, because of this, you wont need to order a sulfur analyzer for the Needles facility.  This should save you about $40K).  There was also an issue with manufacturers quarantees regarding particulate matter emissions from the turbine and catepillar.  This has been resolved also.

Stations 3 and 4.  I received a call from Roger Kohn, the permit engineer for the EPA.  He is satisified with the permit application contents and has also approved stain tubes for the sulfur measurement at these locations.  There are no outstanding issues on these permits from the EPA.  The public comment period for the Station 3 and 4 permits ends Nov.  3.  After this date, it will take 1-2 weeks for the Regional Administrator of the EPA to sign off on the permits  and then he will have them issued to Transwestern.  As of this date, there have been no comments submitted to the EPA for the permits for station 3 and or 4.

Ill keep everyone apprised of future events.

Because I get mail through several different email addresses, I frequently
get duplicates (or triplicates or more-plicates) of various spam messages.
In saving spam for later analysis I haven't always been careful to avoid
saving such duplicates.

I wrote a script some time ago to try an minimize the duplicates I see by
calculating a loose checksum, but I still have some duplicates.  Should I
delete the duplicates before training or not?  Would people be interested in
the script?  I'd be happy to extricate it from my local modules and check it

	3.	u can maybe see the cf score with ‚Äìdebug. sa in debug mode makes razor vomit tons of junk incl scores and cf valz.

side Q: is slashdot diggest a multipart mime msg? razor calls it spam if any part matches lol. probs bc spam & ham both got empty mime bits. i hacked razor-agent.conf 2 chill out false flags. downside = missin some spam. sad face.

logic_method           = 5        # flag only if ALL parts hit  
min_cf                 = ac + 10  # need a bit more than avg conf  

this made it less annoying 4 me. still not perf tho.
