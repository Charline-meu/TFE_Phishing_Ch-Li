Good day,

You may find this message unexpected, and I fully understand if it comes as a surprise.

I am reaching out in confidence regarding a matter of strategic business positioning. Our family, historically involved in state-level ventures in Central Africa, is currently navigating a sensitive transition following a realignment of national interests.

Certain reserved assets (estimated at approximately 30M USD) are currently under private management. These holdings have been placed in a secure trust arrangement pending their reassignment to a reliable associate capable of facilitating global business engagement.

We are seeking a third-party introducer to act in a private liaison capacity on matters relating to these assets. In return for facilitation and administrative support, an equity allocation has been outlined as part of the initial agreement.

This inquiry is intended solely for a discrete audience. If you are open to an exploratory discussion, you may respond via secure message or voice contact at your discretion. Further procedural details will be shared upon expression of preliminary interest.

Hi,

Hope you’re doing well.

This message is shared following a brief internal review. We’re currently compiling a list of available contacts for potential collaboration on an international planning initiative, focused on long-term restructuring in key markets (Central Africa).

One of the topics we’d like to explore relates to a portfolio of holdings (approx. 30M USD), currently managed through a private administrative trust. Our goal is to identify partners who may be open to a preliminary call or digital sync next week—Monday or Sunday afternoon might work best.

Please note:
This is not a public solicitation, and the scope of involvement would be clarified in advance. Any discussion would remain confidential, per internal policy.

If you’d like to check availability, feel free to reply to this message or confirm a preferred time via calendar invite.

Thanks again for your attention—and happy to provide more details.

Greetings,

This message is shared in good faith and intended for preliminary review.

Following a review of international introductions, your profile was referenced during an advisory consultation. I’m currently exploring partnership channels relating to legacy-held assets stored under custodial protection with a financial institution in West Africa. The deposit in question was registered under private family arrangements and remains intact pending reassignment.

For context, the original depositor (now deceased) foresaw instability in our region and opted for discrete preservation of holdings now totaling approximately USD 9.2M. The mandate now rests with direct family successors—myself and a sibling—who have relocated under protected status in Dakar, Senegal. We are actively pursuing qualified conduits for external stewardship and reinvestment in politically neutral jurisdictions.

A facilitation framework has been drafted and includes a defined incentive for your involvement. We intend to manage all procedural elements to streamline execution under full compliance with regulatory considerations.

Kindly indicate availability for a secured follow-up to outline scope, formalize roles, and proceed to the next stage of onboarding.

With regards,

Our group is currently coordinating preliminary calls regarding external partnership structures tied to legacy portfolio holdings (valued at approx.

The assets were initially reserved under private instructions for contingency planning purposes. The responsible parties—my sibling and I—are seeking a dialogue with select third parties for stewardship and reallocation efforts.

Greetings,

We are reaching out on the basis of a limited-scope reference linked to our extended advisory network. A strategic family entity under protection has identified an opportunity for cross-border asset collaboration in light of recent regional developments.

This involves privately held capital in reserve—previously allocated to defense logistics and now reassigned under legacy succession protocols. Our role, acting as retained advisors, is to identify discrete channels for structured deployment.

A portion of these reserves (USD 25M, initial tranche) is available for immediate positioning. We are currently seeking aligned third-party entities willing to coordinate administrative oversight for asset migration under risk-mitigated terms.

Should this initiative fall within your operational bandwidth, we can initiate secure briefings on conditions, risk management guarantees, and compliance scaffolding. Value-sharing arrangements are pre-structured, with flexibility based on early-stage alignment.

Due to the sensitive nature of the origin and current holding protocols, all disclosures and transactional phases must remain strictly confidential.

If alignment appears possible, we will forward full procedural briefings and credential validation.

We appreciate your time in reviewing this proposal.

Hi,

Hope you’re having a smooth start to the week.

We’re touching base with a small list of external consultants regarding a restructuring initiative for a legacy account (USD 25M – first stage). This capital reserve was previously earmarked for government-facing logistics and is now being transitioned into a private succession framework.

As part of the process, we’re seeking available contributors for advisory alignment and potential oversight. If Sunday or early next week works for a brief discussion, we can confirm timing and send a calendar invite.

Please let us know your availability for a short sync (15–20 min). All preliminary documentation, legal briefs, and credential references can be shared in PDF format once the schedule is firmed.

Requested Info for Verification:
	•	Full name (as registered)
	•	Preferred delivery site (home or business)
	•	Local contact number
	•	Availability window
	•	Title / role reference

Please feel free to direct replies or scheduling notes to:
