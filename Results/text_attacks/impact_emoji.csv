Greetings,

I am a family member of a former national leader from Central Africa. Due to current political sensitivities, we are in a transitional period which limits international financial operations. Certain entities have taken actions that have affected our ability to manage key assets abroad.

At present, a set of resources has been deposited securely via a trusted international custodian firm. We are seeking a reliable associate to serve as a reference contact and facilitator for an investment initiative. The opportunity involves facilitating the relocation and future structuring of the assets into selected market ventures of mutual agreement.

The arrangement includes full authorization to coordinate on our behalf, as well as agreed recognition for collaboration, which we can discuss further. Support with this process would be highly valued, and we are open to mutually beneficial terms including performance-based incentives and necessary cost considerations.

Should this be of interest, please direct a message to:

Hello,

I hope this message finds you well.

I represent a coordination unit associated with a federal project. In reviewing potential collaborators for a high-trust initiative, your profile emerged during our network evaluations.

This opportunity involves transitioning surplus project capital held in reserve by a public-sector agency. The funds stem from an earlier infrastructure engagement and are fully cleared under internal review. Our objective is to facilitate structured relocation of a portion of the allocation via external guidance.

Due to current operational constraints, we are unable to manage external holdings directly. For this reason, we seek an aligned partner positioned to serve as facilitator and representative.

An outline of proposed allocation:

‚Ä¢ Project Contributors ‚Äì 60%

Dear Colleague,

I am affiliated with a reform-oriented organization operating in a Southern African state. Recent developments in the local business environment have compelled us to explore alternative arrangements for reallocating resources currently under our control.

Following a series of internal disposals involving real estate and industrial holdings, we have secured proceeds totaling approximately USD 18.5M. These assets are currently in a secure holding environment in the United Arab Emirates. Our objective is to identify a reliable collaborator to assist with facilitating structured reallocation into more stable jurisdictions.

Two possible frameworks are proposed:
	1.	Transactional Role ‚Äì Compensation to be provided for enabling financial facilitation.
	2.	Investment Partnership ‚Äì Joint venture initiative for asset deployment in agreed commercial channels.

A reserve provision has been designated to accommodate associated facilitation costs.

If this aligns with your strategic outlook and operational bandwidth, we welcome a brief expression of interest. This will enable follow-up via secure channels.

Private Communication ‚Äì Not for Redistribution

We are reaching out on behalf of a family in transition following the loss of a principal figure in the regional trade sector of West Africa. Certain personal holdings, previously registered under a family trust, are now subject to confidential transfer arrangements.

These holdings, valued at approximately USD 12.5M, are currently maintained with a financial institution in C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire. The designated beneficiary has authorization to initiate relocation proceedings but is seeking support in identifying a trusted individual abroad to facilitate the asset transition process.

In return for enabling the reallocation of this capital to a designated safe jurisdiction, the facilitator will be entitled to a portion of the total value as an incentive, along with an optional collaboration in ongoing enterprise ventures.

Dear Partner,

Do accept my sincere apologies if my mail does not meet your personal ethics.  For i know this may seem like a complete intrusion to your privacy but right about now this is my option of communication. This note might seem strange or probably untrue considering the amount of junk mails we receive daily, but i believe this is still the most genuine way of contacting a true character. 

I will introduce myself as the Head of Foreign Operations Department in the accounts management section this well-known bank here in the United Kingdom as Stated above. I am seeking your cooperation to present you to my bank as the Next of kin to LATE ANDREA SCHRANNER. A Germany property Magnate Andreas Schranner, 64, his wife Maria, 62, their daughter Andrea Eich, 38, her husband Christian, 57, and their children Katharina, eight, and Maximilian, 10, all perished in the jet.

Please click here below for verification. 

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm
 
PROPOSITION:
One of late Andrea Schranner's accounts with holding balance of 15,000,000(Fifteen Million British Pounds) has been dormant and has not been operated for the past 5 years and the DEPOSIT will be converted to UNCLAIMED  DEPOSIT and therefore forfeited if nobody comes forward to lay claim to the deposit before the end of this financial quarter, as is the practice and also indicated in the EU banking guidelines.
 
>From my investigations and confirmation, the owner of this account a foreigner by name Late Andrea Schranner's died on MONDAY, 31 JULY,2000 in a plane crash with his family.

After going through the deceased records and files, I discovered that: 
(1) No one has operated this account since 2000;
(2) He died without a heir; hence the money has been floating. 
(3) No other person knows about this account and there was no known beneficiary. 

And if we do not remit this money urgently, it would be confiscated and forfeited for nothing. I have secretly discussed this matter with account officer and we have agreed to find a reliable foreign partner to deal with. We thus propose to do business with you, standing in as the next of kin of these funds from the deceased and funds released to you after due processes have been followed. 
 
This transaction is totally free of risk and troubles as the fund is a legitimate and does not originate from drug, money laundering, terrorism or any other illegal act. On your interest, let me hear from you.


On your interest, let me have your private/direct contact numbers including fax and a copy of your International Passport or driver's license for easy communication, identification and trust. I must be reached only on my private contact details for confidential reasons.

Mr. Gary Fredricks
